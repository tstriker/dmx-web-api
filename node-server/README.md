A tiny node server that uses sockets to chat between the browser and the DMX.
This is specifically for enttec's open USB and is relying on the `enttec-open-dmx-usb` node package to do the heavy lifting.
This is preferable when you don't want to worry about tab visibility, or the browser going crazy etc.

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
1. Start the server: `npm run dmx`
1. Add client code from `browser-backend.js` to your project

If you have any questions, file a ticket in github!
